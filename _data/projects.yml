    - We propose a novel approach & techniques which helps for any goal-oriented conversational 
      agents, to improve their system responses that will be informative, diverse ,leading to better
      user experience.

      - Introduced a novel loss formulation derived from GAN based network in which discriminator 
        network provides strong supervision to generator for erasing the artifacts generated from 
        pre-trained perceptual loss function.
      - Utilizing the latent features from the discriminator, we adaptively filter the unwanted 
        information introduced by the perceptual loss.

    - We present a system which analyses the emergency-related tweets to classify
      them as need and available tweets.
    - Real-time analysis of this huge collected data can play a vital role in crisis assessment,
      response and relief activities.
